<h1 class="heading"> Project 1: Emotimatch </h1>
<p> Emotimatch was a concept developed by my group for the congressional app challenge meant to help teens gain more control over their emotions and connect with people similar to them in order to help each other. 
This project came out extremely well, and I loved the concepts of the app that we incorporated into our figma's design. A struggle of this challenge was being faced with limitied time, but we were able to tackle the challenge using the 
innovative ideas we came up with along the way. </p>

<p> This was something I was personally proud of myself for. When trying to introduce a mentor feature to our app, we were tasked with the challenge of being able to paint a vivid picture of how it would work.
Thankfully, I was able to create what I believe was a very thorough and in-depth analysis into our mentors and how they converse with the users of our app. </p>

<p> Lastly, another design by myself, our app's survey. This is the foundation of our app, and tells users exactly where they are and what they need to work on. In addition, this survey can be repeated in order to measure 
progress in an effective way. These qualities made our survey one of the highlights of our app.</p>
