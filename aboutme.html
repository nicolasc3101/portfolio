  <p> As said throughout the portfolio, my name is Nicolas Castillo. I'm a 17 year old senior at Thomas Edison high school (seen above). I enjoy doing plenty of different things. One of my favorite things that I enjoy
    is football. Above is one of my favorite college football teams, the Colorado Buffaloes. Football has been enjoyable to me for a long time. I originally started playing when I was 10 years old. Then I played when I was 14,
    But developed the most love for it starting in my junior year when I decided to play again. Football is such an enjoyable experience, and I've learned so much throughout my time on the team. During my junior year, after 
    only playing 2 games, I tore my ACL. It was extremely disappointing, but over the next year I learned so much and had an amazing recovery, which led me back to finally being able to play the sport I loved. Just like football, 
    I believe plenty of other things in life are valuable experiences to learn from, and that it's always good to see things in a positive light and think about what you can take away from the situation. I also love music of all 
    different types, and have been heavily into video games since I was little. I love going out and traveling, which has led me to eventually make the decision to want to go to college far from home, in a warmer and more 
    beautiful place to get a fresh change from NY. These are a lot of the things that I enjoy and value, as well as things I take interest in. This is a little bit about me, and I hope you found something you can relate to or are
    interested in! </p>
