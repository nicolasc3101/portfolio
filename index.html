 <p> My name is Nicolas Castillo. In this portfolio, there is a wide variety of tools, pages and words to help you understand a lot more about who I am and the things I've done. In the navigation bar above, you can access the different pages of my portfolio.
 There is a page for my projects I've worked on, a page for my resume, a page about me that will give you a deeper insight to who I am, and finally a page with all info to contact me.  </p>
